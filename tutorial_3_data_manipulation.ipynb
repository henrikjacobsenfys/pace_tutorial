    "## Manipulating the data\n",
    "There are two important ways to manipulate these large data sets: background subtraction and symmetrisation. We shall here go through both of them, starting with background subtraction. We first need to discuss `sqw` and `dnd` objects, then we have a look at our data once more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on .sqw vs dnd objects\n",
    "The data in a `sqw` object (a file or a slice/cut that is stored in memory) is a list of pixels, the calculated values of `h`, `k`, `l` and `E`, and the neutron intensities and variances. When we plot a `sqw` object, the data is binned into the chosen bins and plotted. However, the original data persits, and no information is lost, no matter which way we cut and slice a `sqw` object.\n",
    "When subtracting backgroumd, we want to extrapolate the background to other regions, which is meaningless for a `sqw` object. \n",
    "To solve this problem, any `sqw` object can be converted to a `dnd` object, where the `n` is the number of dimensions. Here, we'll work with `d1d` and `d2d` objects. They are essentialy matrices with the binning defined in the cut command. Such matrices can of course be replicated and manipulated in the way we want to, to subtract the background."
