    "## Plotting the data\n",
    "Now it's time to have fun plotting the data. We need to define which axes we want to view the data along. For example, sometimes we may want to view along (1,0,0), (0,1,0) and (0,0,1), while other times, it may be useful to view along a different pair of directions, such as (1,1,0),(1,-1,0) and (0,0,1). The choice of primary axes is made using the proj dictionary, as seen below.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a plot, we need to cut the .sqw file in some way. We use the `cut_sqw` command for this. It takes as input the `.sqw` file, the projection axes, and four arrays: one for each primary axis, the fourth being energy. For each of the arrays, there are two options. If the user provides two values, e.g. `[-0.1,0.1]` the counts between these two values are summed, and the axis is not viewed. If the user provides three values, e.g. `[-2,0.05,1]`, the data is binned along this axis in bins starting at the first value (`-2`), with a step size of the middle value (`0.05`), ending at the last value (`1`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The type of cut therefore depends on how many directions the user sums over. Some examples are given below.\n",
    "\n",
